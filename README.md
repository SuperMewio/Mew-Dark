# Mew-Dark
Dark color scheme for KDE to fit my own likes and because there was no dark scheme dark enough for me on the KDE store. I use this color scheme with [Klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) usually but it looks great with stock Breeze too. I will continue to push changes as I update this further.

I started with the colors scheme [AksDark](https://store.kde.org/p/1971781) and modified it from there. I think there may be one or two colors left from this theme and likely other things that I did not modify that was unavailable in the KDE Color Editor so I figured I would credit them just in case. I may either compare files in the future or move my base color scheme to breeze dark so I can better move away from the source material. AksDark is a great color scheme within it self let alone the theme it belongs to so I recommend checking it out.

To install, open a terminal and type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuperMewio/Mew-Dark.git
cd Mew-Dark
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
