# Mew-Dark
Dark color scheme for KDE to fit my own likes and because there was no dark scheme dark enough for me on the KDE store. I use this color scheme with [Klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) usually but it looks great with stock Breeze too. Used Breeze-dark as the base file for this color scheme I will continue to push changes as I learn about creating color schemes and update this further. If you have any suggestions, you are free to open an issue.

This script currently will install the colors scheme to <code>~/.local/share/color-schemes</code>. You will have to copy the colors file manually with sudo if you would like it installed to <code>/usr/share/color-schemes</code> to use it system wide.

To install, open a terminal and type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuperMewio/Mew-Dark.git
cd Mew-Dark
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
