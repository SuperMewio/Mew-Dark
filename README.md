# Mew-Dark
Dark color scheme for KDE to fit my own likes and because there was no dark scheme dark enough for me on the KDE store. I use this color scheme with [Klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) usually but it looks great with stock Breeze too. I will continue to push changes as I update this further.

I started with the colors scheme [AksDark](https://store.kde.org/p/1971781) and modified it from there. I think there may be one or two colors left from this theme so I figured I would credit them just in case. It mnay change further as I continue to tweak this theme to my liking.

To install, open a terminal and type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuperMewio/Mew-Dark.git
cd Mew-Dark
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
