# Mew-Dark
Dark color scheme for KDE to fit my own likes and because there was no dark scheme dark enough for me on the KDE store. I use this color scheme with [Klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) usually but it looks great with stock Breeze too. Used Breeze-dark as the base file for this color scheme I will continue to push changes as I update this further.

To install, open a terminal and type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/SuperMewio/Mew-Dark.git
cd Mew-Dark
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
